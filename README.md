### How I got idea and offer for Internship ?

- I didn't have any idea about what I will do in my summer break time may be I will do full time job at Mcdonald's with minimum wage.
- After my final exams for first year in my course, I put my LinkedIn profile as "Seeking for Summer Internship or Full Time Temparory Job".
- I started laughing on myself that without having canadian work experiance who will hire me for Summer Intern.
- Starting May,2022 , I recieved below message from one of the well known company's Talent Acquisition Business Parter

### What happened after I applied as Intern?

- I recieved below replay from recruiter 

              Hi Dhruv! Is there any chance we can have a quick phone interview today?

              Thank you
              
- Stage 1 : Phone Interview 
  
   - There was some preparation I started doing.
      
      - How I will Introduce myself.
      - What things I will have to explain while they will ask me about my perious experience.
      
   - Phone Interview Time
   
      - Give me brief introduction about myself.
      - Previous experience about work I have done
      - College and Personal Projects decription that I have done
      - General basic coding lanuage I know
     
- Stage 2 : Coding Interview 

    - After my phone interview, I received positive feedback from recruiter about my phone interview
      and they put me forward for another stage of interview 
     
    - I started brainstorming about lanuages I know , Like c++, Java, Android, Web Development, Python, A.I./Machine Learning 
    
    - Coding Interview Time
      
       - I received total 3 questions for Coding.
        
          - Q - 1 : "Develop Application in python using ...... in python" (Successfully executed and Passed)
          
          - Q - 2 : Already given program as python and ask me to change things as he said line by line (Successfully executed and Passed)
                
                - Basically, He was testing my problem solving skills and How fast I can adopt and apply things
             
          
          - Q - 3 : "Develop another Application in python using....."
          
                - I failed executing program, as it was quite hard and not easily understaning for me, 
                  and Simply, I said "I dont have idea for this one Sorry". 
                
                - Examiner started giving me hints how to do it and I started doing it the way he explained me 
                  and because of his help, I successfully executed the code.
                  
       - Overall, He was checking my level and how fastly I can understand, adopt and apply things quickly.
       
- Stage 3 : Behaviour and Experience/Projects Interview 

    - Behaviour Interview 
        
        - Interviewer asked me some basic terms and some introduction about that terms:
            
            - Agile Model and Project Management terms
            - Java Development
            - Application Development
            - Database Information and terms
            
    - Information Interview
    
        - What things I have done previously as work ?
        - What projects I have done ?
        - Achivements
        - College, School Projects
        
        
                  Main reason why we do not have to lie or hide things in Interview :
                  Interview asked me to show all projects that I have done in my college time and documentaion if project is not available,
                  in my laptop;
                  
                  Definetly, One project wasn't available in laptop so I told him "Can I explain that project verbally as project is not,
                  available in my laptop",
                  He agreed and I explain the peoject I didn't have in my laptop
                  
                  So think, what If I lied in Information Interview about projects/experience, sure I would not get internship 
                  and I would cry seating in cornor.
                  
                  Conclusion : Always be honest and be straight-forward.

 - After 2 days, I recieved call "Congrats Dhruv, You did wonderful job in interview and good news is that you are selected as Summer Intern 2022".
 
 - After few days, I have received Offer Letter about 10-weeks Paid Summer Internship 2022 from June to August 2022.
